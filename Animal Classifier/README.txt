To test out this algorithm, first open guess.rkt. Then, run the program and call (train-classifier (random-animals X)) where X is any positive number. Note that the larger X is, the more accurate the result will be. Also note that random-animals is a function that outputs a list of X lists which each include an animal and their attributes. You can test this by calling (random-animals X).
